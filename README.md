# Coursecha: Empowering Urban Microfarming through Personalized Learning üå±

## Introduction üåø

To this day, we only have less than 30 years before the possible collapse of earth's support systems (https://www.theworldcounts.com/challenges/state-of-the-planet/the-end-of-the-world) 

Nearly 51 million Filipinos face food insecurity. The Philippines had the highest number of moderately or severely food-insecure in the region, accounting for almost half of the 110.9 million total in Southeast Asia. (UN Report, 2023).

Approximately 40% of Zamboanga City‚Äôs supply of vegetables is domestically grown, while the remaining 60% is imported from across the country. (WWF-Philippines).

A study conducted by the University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os revealed that the average age of Filipino farmers is 53 years old.

Coursecha is a web application that aims to revolutionize the learning experience of people who want to get into farming. This project is in collaboration with Kids Who Farm PH. The app leverages the power of Google Gemini to provide **personalized learning paths** and **interactive support**, empowering learners to **upskill themselves effectively in urban microfarming**.


## Overview üí°

**This is an entry project for the "PSITS: Siklab - TechSolve" event,** Coursecha addresses the challenges faced by people who want to get into farming in acquiring the necessary skills due to a lack of **structured and personalized learning resources**. We believe Coursecha has the potential to make a significant impact on Kids Who Farm's mission and empower young Filipinos to become effective agents of change.

Coursecha's solution has the potential to address several UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly:
